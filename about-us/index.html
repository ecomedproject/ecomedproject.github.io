<h2><a name="mission_statement"></a>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The EMP’s mission is to promote cultural exchange in the art of medicine and create a global dialogue between health professionals about facilitating progressive and sustainable practices.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a name="our_focus"></a>Our Focus</h2>
<p>The EcoMed Project’s goals focus on preventative health, education programs, and promoting sustainable medical care in harmony with the surrounding environment and culture of under-served populations. Our current efforts are in Zambia where the EMP sends pre-medical students and medical students to volunteer at rural health clinics which serve the Lozi community. The largest clinic and operating room are located in Sioma. The new outpatient clinic and maternity/delivery ward, recently built by funding from the EMP, is located in Sankande. The government has staffed the Sankande clinic, however a clinical officer’s house still needs to be finished in order to have a full-time healthcare worker available. Volunteers reside at our partner’s campsite, ZEEC (Zambezi Environmental Education Camp), a 6 hour drive from Livingstone, Zambia. Each year, volunteers help raise funds for pertinent health-related projects desired by the local community. When they travel to Zambia, volunteers help in the clinics and on outreach medical trips to remote villages.</p>

<h2><a name="history"></a>History of the Sioma Medical Clinic</h2>
<p>In the late 1990’s, Dr. Curtis of Dartmouth University started volunteering his services at a medical clinic in the rural village of Sioma, Zambia after a piece of land was granted to him as a thank you for performing surgery to a royal family member. A few years later his parents founded an international environmental school, <a title="ZEEC" href="http://www.hohliebi.ch/Zambia/index.htm" target="_blank">ZEEC (Zambezi Environmental Education Camp)</a>, which has helped to build part of the schools in Sankande. ZEEC is a member of the Wildlife and Conservation Society of Zambia and is registered as a non-profit NGO. The directors, Alison and John Curtis, take groups of international high school students to stay at the ZEEC camp up to three times a year, giving students a unique opportunity to observe and experience a culture (Lozi) with strong, functioning traditions operating on a subsistence economy.</p>
<p>The EcoMed Project was founded after the director, Vanessa Scott, traveled to and volunteered at the Sioma Clinic. It was a life-changing experience and one that motivated the establishment of the EMP and its fundraising efforts. Funding for both the EMP and ZEEC is dependent on donations from family and friends, grants and grassroots fundraising. Both the EMP and ZEEC are supported by the Watoto Charitable Trust (WCT), an IRS approved, 501(c)3 organization.</p>

<div>
<h2><a name="priorities"></a>Priorities</h2>
<p>The EMP’s current efforts focus on sending pre-medical students, medical students and, in the future we hope physicians, to volunteer at rural health clinics in southwest Zambia which serve the Lozi people.  The main outpatient clinic, adult, children and delivery wards, and the operating room are located at the Sioma Clinic.  After a request from the local community, the EMP fully funded the building of a second medical clinic in Sankande, where most of the Lozi children attend school. The Sankande clinic will serve as a delivery room, pre and post natal care clinic, and an emergency outpost for the Sioma Clinic. This clinical infrastructure was made possible by the EMP’s volunteers over the past three summers and donations from friends and family. We are very grateful for everyone’s support!</p>
<p>In the future, the EMP aims to facilitate health education programs on various medical topics pertinent to the Lozi culture and lifestyle. Part of the EMP’s mission this year is to take a survey from the community in order to determine what areas of health care education would be most beneficial. We also hope to communicate with the local government staff to help establish programs that reflect the highest health priorities of the Lozi community. Local staff would be hired and trained to deliver such programs, promoting empowerment and sustainability within the community. In addition to educational materials, the EMP is interested in providing sustainable and eco-friendly medical equipment, such as solar-powered blood pressure machines and lighting in the clinics.</p>

<h2><a name="future_goals"></a>Future Goals</h2>
<p><strong>For the next 1-3 years, goals for the EMP include:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Complete funding for a clinical officer&#8217;s house at the newly completed Sankande Clinic, which will require about US$10,000.</li>
<li>Set up a program to send surgeons to perform operations in the OR and various other specialists.</li>
<li>Raise funds to build a local community center to host health education programs, a library, and an internet connection with a computer charged by a solar powered charger for the clinic staff to remain in contact with the EMP.</li>
<li>Create opportunities for volunteers to be there for 1-3 months at a time (right now they only go for 2 weeks), and include a week at a hospital in Livingstone.</li>
<li>Create a local, Zambian community of students and physicians who promote awareness of preventative medicine and the need for global health education. This includes appointing a board, finding physicians who are mentors, and initiating research projects.</li>
